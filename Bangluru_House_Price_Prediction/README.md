This is a project based on Bangluru House Price Prediction.

In this project i've created a model that predicts home prices in different regions in Bangluru. The model predicts prices based on:

1.Bedroom/Hall/kitchen(BHK) 
2.Bathroom
3.Location
4.Area (sqft)


I tried three different algorithms to build the model.
1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Lasso Regression

These are results i get after building these models. Here Linear Regression gives better accuracy than other algorithms.

#Requirements
1.Numpy
2.Pandas for loading dataset and perform various tasks like EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering.
3.Matplotlib for visualisation
4.Sklearn to create model and compare model accuracy.
5.Flask to build python flask server and run webpages on home directory.

#Tools used
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Pycharm IDE
4.Visual Studio Code
5.HTML/CSS/JS
