This is a project based on Bangaluru House Price Prediction.

In this project i've created a model that predicts home prices in different regions in Bangluru. The model predicts prices based on:

1.BHK    
2.Location   
3.Area (sqft)   
4.Bathroom 
  
#Algorithms used to build the model.
1.Linear Regression 
2.Decision Tree   				
3.LASSO Regression

These are results i get after building these models. Here Linear Regression gives better accuracy than other algorithms.
