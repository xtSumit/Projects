This is a classification project that classifies whether the give image is a cat or a dog. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle.
Dataset composition: 1. training set = 20000
                     2. validation set = 3000
                     3. validation set = 2000
                     
I've used different approches to train the model. A simple convolution network with 3 layers and 1 fully connected layer which gives accuracy of 89.97% on validation set and 88.7 on test set.
Then i trained another model with pre-trained architecture MobileNet which gives accuracy of
